Cognitive Intraindividual variability in injection drug use among Hispanic residents of Puerto Rico.,"",2024,10.1080/23279095.2024.2389564,"Despite a high prevalence of injection drug use (IDU) in Puerto Rico, little is known about how it affects neuropsychological functioning in this population. Investigations of intra-individual variability (IIV) have alluded to its utility as a potential indicator of neural decline. The purpose of this study was to characterize IIV among Hispanic residents of Puerto Rico who engage in IDU. Injectors and non-injectors completed the Neuropsí Atención y Memoria battery. Measures of IIV were calculated for the overall test battery (OTB), the three battery indices, and three domains of attention, memory, and executive functioning. The injector group showed significantly greater IIV than the non-injector group on all measures (OTB, indices, and individual domains). Additionally, injectors showed significantly higher IIV in the domain of executive functioning compared to other cognitive domains and battery indices. In contrast, non-injectors did not show any significant within-group differences on any IIV measures. The higher performance variability observed in the IDU group suggests a negative influence of IDU on cognition, with executive functioning being more susceptible to these effects. These findings support the need for continued investigations into the clinical application of IIV for diagnostic and prognostic purposes in the Hispanic IDU population.",Unknown authors.

Contribution of memory T cells to the generation of long-lasting immunity against COVID-19.,"",2024,10.24875/GMM.M24000878,"Humans are exposed every day to innumerable external stimuli, both environmental and microbial. Immunological memory recalls each specific stimulus and mounts a secondary response that is faster and of a larger magnitude than the primary response; this process constitutes the basis for vaccine development. The COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to study the development of immune memory against an emergent microorganism. Memory T cells have an important role in the resolution of COVID-19, and they are key pillars of immunological memory. In this review, we summarize the main findings regarding anti-SARS-CoV-2 memory T cells after infection, after vaccination, and after the combination of these two events (""hybrid immunity""), and analyze how these cells can contribute to long-term protection against the infection with SARS-CoV-2 variants.",Unknown authors.

A low-cost and open-hardware portable 3-electrode sleep monitoring device.,"",2024,10.1016/j.ohx.2024.e00553,"To continue sleep research activities during the lockdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, experiments that were previously conducted in laboratories were shifted to the homes of volunteers. Furthermore, for extensive data collection, it is necessary to use a large number of portable devices. Hence, to achieve these objectives, we developed a low-cost and open-source portable monitor (PM) device capable of acquiring electroencephalographic (EEG) signals using the popular ESP32 microcontroller. The device operates based on instrumentation amplifiers. It also has a connectivity microcontroller with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth that can be used to stream EEG signals. This portable single-channel 3-electrode EEG device allowed us to record short naps and score different sleep stages, such as wakefulness, non rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), stage 1 (S1), stage 2 (S2), stage 3 (S3) and stage 4 (S4). We validated the device by comparing the obtained signals to those generated by a research-grade counterpart. The results showed a high level of accurate similarity between both devices, demonstrating the feasibility of using this approach for extensive and low-cost data collection of EEG sleep recordings.",Unknown authors.

Differential effects of clonazepam on declarative memory formation and face recognition.,"",2024,10.1016/j.nlm.2024.107956,"Benzodiazepines are commonly used drugs to treat anxiety in crime witnesses. These increase GABA inhibitory effects, which impairs aversive memory encoding and consolidation. Eyewitness memory is essential in justice. However, memory is malleable leading to false memories that could cause a selection of an innocent in a lineup. Here, we studied whether a low dose of Clonazepam impairs memory encoding as well as consolidation of faces and narrative of the event. We performed two experiments using a double-blind and between subject design (N = 216). Day 1: subjects watched a crime video and received Clonazepam 0.25 mg (CLZ group) or placebo (PLC group) before (Exp. 1) or after the video (Exp. 2) to assess the effect on encoding and consolidation. One week later, the memory was assessed using a present and absent target lineup and asking for a free recall. Regarding encoding, we found that in the CLZ group memory was impaired in the free recall task, while no differences were found for recognition memory. Regarding consolidation, we did not observe memory measures that were affected by this dose of benzodiazepines. The results suggest that while some aspects of eyewitness memory could be modulated even with low doses of benzodiazepine, others could not be affected. More studies should be performed with higher doses of CLZ similar to those administered in real life. These results are relevant in the judicial field to assess the reliability of the eyewitness elections under the effects of this drug.",Unknown authors.

Allostatic Interoceptive Overload Across Psychiatric and Neurological Conditions.,"",2024,10.1016/j.biopsych.2024.06.024,"Emerging theories emphasize the crucial role of allostasis (anticipatory and adaptive regulation of the body's biological processes) and interoception (integration, anticipation, and regulation of internal bodily states) in adjusting physiological responses to environmental and bodily demands. In this review, we explore the disruptions in integrated allostatic interoceptive mechanisms in psychiatric and neurological disorders, including anxiety, depression, Alzheimer's disease, and frontotemporal dementia. We assess the biological mechanisms associated with allostatic interoception, including whole-body cascades, brain structure and function of the allostatic interoceptive network, heart-brain interactions, respiratory-brain interactions, the gut-brain-microbiota axis, peripheral biological processes (inflammatory, immune), and epigenetic pathways. These processes span psychiatric and neurological conditions and call for developing dimensional and transnosological frameworks. We synthesize new pathways to understand how allostatic interoceptive processes modulate interactions between environmental demands and biological functions in brain disorders. We discuss current limitations of the framework and future transdisciplinary developments. This review opens a new research agenda for understanding how allostatic interoception involves brain predictive coding in psychiatry and neurology, allowing for better clinical application and the development of new therapeutic interventions.",Unknown authors.

Retrieval of contextual memory can be predicted by CA3 remapping and is differentially influenced by NMDAR activity in rat hippocampus subregions.,"",2024,10.1371/journal.pbio.3002706,"Episodic memory is essential to navigate in a changing environment by recalling past events, creating new memories, and updating stored information from experience. Although the mechanisms for acquisition and consolidation have been profoundly studied, much less is known about memory retrieval. Hippocampal spatial representations are key for retrieval of contextually guided episodic memories. Indeed, hippocampal place cells exhibit stable location-specific activity which is thought to support contextual memory, but can also undergo remapping in response to environmental changes. It is unclear if remapping is directly related to the expression of different episodic memories. Here, using an incidental memory recognition task in rats, we showed that retrieval of a contextually guided memory is reflected by the levels of CA3 remapping, demonstrating a clear link between external cues, hippocampal remapping, and episodic memory retrieval that guides behavior. Furthermore, we describe NMDARs as key players in regulating the balance between retrieval and memory differentiation processes by controlling the reactivation of specific memory traces. While an increase in CA3 NMDAR activity boosts memory retrieval, dentate gyrus NMDAR activity enhances memory differentiation. Our results contribute to understanding how the hippocampal circuit sustains a flexible balance between memory formation and retrieval depending on the environmental cues and the internal representations of the individual. They also provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the contributions of hippocampal subregions to generate this balance.",Unknown authors.

Social interaction-induced fear memory reduction: exploring the influence of dopamine and oxytocin receptors on memory updating.,"",2024,10.1038/s41398-024-02955-3,"It has been well established that a consolidated memory can be updated during the plastic state induced by reactivation. This updating process opens the possibility to modify maladaptive memory. In the present study, we evaluated whether fear memory could be updated to less-aversive level by incorporating hedonic information during reactivation. Thus, male rats were fear conditioned and, during retrieval, a female was presented as a social rewarding stimulus. We found that memory reactivation with a female (but not a male) reduces fear expression within-session and in the test, without presenting reinstatement or spontaneous recovery. Interestingly, this intervention impaired extinction. Finally, we demonstrated that this emotional remodeling to eliminate fear expression requires the activation of dopamine and oxytocin receptors during retrieval. Hence, these results shed new lights on the memory updating process and suggests that the exposure to natural rewarding information such as a female during retrieval reduces a previously consolidated fear memory.",Unknown authors.

Automated free speech analysis reveals distinct markers of Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia.,"",2024,10.1371/journal.pone.0304272,"Dementia can disrupt how people experience and describe events as well as their own role in them. Alzheimer's disease (AD) compromises the processing of entities expressed by nouns, while behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) entails a depersonalized perspective with increased third-person references. Yet, no study has examined whether these patterns can be captured in connected speech via natural language processing tools. To tackle such gaps, we asked 96 participants (32 AD patients, 32 bvFTD patients, 32 healthy controls) to narrate a typical day of their lives and calculated the proportion of nouns, verbs, and first- or third-person markers (via part-of-speech and morphological tagging). We also extracted objective properties (frequency, phonological neighborhood, length, semantic variability) from each content word. In our main study (with 21 AD patients, 21 bvFTD patients, and 21 healthy controls), we used inferential statistics and machine learning for group-level and subject-level discrimination. The above linguistic features were correlated with patients' scores in tests of general cognitive status and executive functions. We found that, compared with HCs, (i) AD (but not bvFTD) patients produced significantly fewer nouns, (ii) bvFTD (but not AD) patients used significantly more third-person markers, and (iii) both patient groups produced more frequent words. Machine learning analyses showed that these features identified individuals with AD and bvFTD (AUC = 0.71). A generalizability test, with a model trained on the entire main study sample and tested on hold-out samples (11 AD patients, 11 bvFTD patients, 11 healthy controls), showed even better performance, with AUCs of 0.76 and 0.83 for AD and bvFTD, respectively. No linguistic feature was significantly correlated with cognitive test scores in either patient group. These results suggest that specific cognitive traits of each disorder can be captured automatically in connected speech, favoring interpretability for enhanced syndrome characterization, diagnosis, and monitoring.",Unknown authors.

Youth-like brain activation linked with greater cognitive training gains in older adults: Insights from the ACTOP study.,"",2024,10.1016/j.cortex.2024.04.013,"This study investigates the relationship between inter-individual neurofunctional differences in older adults and cognitive training efficacy, with a specific focus on the association between youth-like task-related brain activation and improvements in working memory (WM) training. The data is part of the Attentional Control Training for Older People (ACTOP) study, 30 older adults completed 12 half-hour WM training sessions. The WM performance slope, assessed at the conclusion of sessions 1 through 6 and sessions 7 to 12, determined early- and late-stage training gains, respectively. Transfer measures were taken before (PRE), midway (MID), and after (POST) training, and the differences in MID-PRE and POST-MID on transfer tasks were used to determine early- and late-stage transfer effects, respectively. The Goodness of Fit (GOF) metric was used to quantify the similarity between each older adult's activation pattern, as measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to that of a group of younger adults. GOF scores were calculated for activation during low-load (1-0back) and high-load (2-0back) N-back tasks. The results indicated that larger GOF scores in the low-load condition were associated with greater training gains in both the early and late learning stages, and that larger GOF scores in the high-load condition were associated with greater training gains during the late-stage. These findings suggest that a youth-like brain activation pattern in older adults is associated with greater cognitive training benefits, underscoring the role of inter-individual neurofunctional differences to account for variations in training outcomes among older adults.
